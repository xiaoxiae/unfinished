## Gimmick

The game is a top-down shooter, where the main gimmick is that while your movement and shooting mechanics are functional, they are quite weak and bad. You need to edit the code that controls them in order to improve and fight enemies that are faster, smarter and tougher.

## Setting
The setting is a non-procedurally-generated abandoned city, where the main point is to scavenge for scarce resources like health and ammo. The longer you survive, the tougher the enemies get and the scarcer the resources are.
