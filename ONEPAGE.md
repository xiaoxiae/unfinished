# One-page design document
The point of this document is to outline the main design of the game **Unfinished.**

---


The game is a top-down shooter, where the main gimmick is that you can enhance your movement with custom code, reacting to how close the enemies are to you. This will be an advantage against enemies that are faster than you.

The setting is a non-procedurally-generated maze, the main point being finding and killing all of the enemies found, while wisely using your stamina and ammo.
